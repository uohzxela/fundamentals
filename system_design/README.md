You don't have to read all of these (especially the papers), but you should have a decent to solid understanding of CAP, consensus protocolsâ€”specifically Paxos, 2 phase commit, Byzantine Generals' problem, concurrency (async vs sync), how to deal with failure generally, FLP, and DB stuff like sharding, federation, replication, BASE vs ACID, etc.
For system design generally / with a focus on scalability, I'd recommend high scalability, hiredintech, and the system design primer.
